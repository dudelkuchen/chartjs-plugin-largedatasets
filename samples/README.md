# chartjs-plugin-largedatasets


[Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) plugin to display large datasets in a line chart.

Requires [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases) **2.8.0** or later.

## Example

Simpel chartjs-plugin-largedatasets plugin example. HTML page can be executed directly in the browser. There you can configure the number of data points and for how many pixels a data point should be drawn. In addition, a chart can be created with or without the largedatasets plug in. 

To run the examples first execute the following commands in the project root folder:

    > npm install 
    > gulp build

**Creating the diagram without the largedatasets plugin and large number of datapoints can lead to long waiting times.**
